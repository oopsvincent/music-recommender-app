### 🎵 **Music Recommender Web App**  

The **Music Recommender App** is a web-based platform designed to suggest personalized music recommendations based on user preferences. Built using **React + JavaScript (frontend)** and **Flask (backend)**, the app collects user input via surveys and delivers curated music suggestions without relying on external APIs.

### 🌟 **Features**  

✅ **User Survey System**: Collects user preferences (e.g., genre, mood, artists) through an interactive survey.  
✅ **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests music based on the collected data using Flask algorithms.  
✅ **Fast and Responsive**: Built with Vite for fast React development and Flask for a lightweight backend.  
✅ **Real-Time Data Flow**: Seamless communication between the frontend and backend for dynamic music suggestions.  
✅ **Secure & Scalable**: Handles user data securely with environment variables and scalable Flask architecture.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  

- **Frontend**: React + JavaScript (Vite), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)  
- **Database**: CSV & MySQL  
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)  

---

### 📊 **How It Works**  

1. **User Input**: Users selects their music preferences.  
2. **Data Processing**: Flask backend analyzes the inputs and matches patterns.  
3. **Music Suggestions**: Personalized recommendations are sent to the frontend.  
4. **Continuous Learning**: Survey data refines recommendations over time.

### 🚀 **Future Scope**  

- **Advanced Recommendation Algorithms** (Collaborative & Content-Based Filtering).  
- **User Authentication** for saving preferences.  
- **Admin Dashboard** to analyze survey insights.  
- **Enhanced UI/UX** with more interactive elements.
